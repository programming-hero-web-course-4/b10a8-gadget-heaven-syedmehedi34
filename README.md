- **Context API**: Managing global state efficiently across the application.
- **Other Tools**: Additional libraries and tools to enhance functionality and performance.

### React Fundamental and Advanced Concepts Used

1.  **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: Enables writing HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, making the UI more readable and declarative.
2.  **Components**: Modular, reusable components that define different parts of the app, such as product cards, navigation bars, and the footer.
3.  **Props**: Passes data from parent to child components, allowing customization and dynamic content for different sections of the app.
4.  **State Management**: Manages data within components (e.g., user inputs, product lists, and cart items) and updates the UI when state changes.
5.  **Event Handling**: Manages user interactions like clicks and form submissions, enhancing interactivity.
6.  **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically displays components based on specific conditions, such as displaying loading indicators or product details based on availability.
7.  **Lists and Keys**: Efficiently renders lists of items (like products) with unique keys for optimized rendering and identification.
8.  **Context API**: Provides a way to share global state across multiple components, avoiding prop drilling (useful for shared data like user authentication and cart data).
9.  **React Router**:
    - **useLocation**: Retrieves the current location object, helpful for conditional rendering based on the current route or page.
    - **useNavigate**: Allows programmatic navigation between pages (e.g., redirecting to the checkout page after adding items to the cart).
    - **useLoaderData** (if using React Router v6): Fetches data for a particular route before rendering, ensuring that essential data is loaded ahead of time.
10. **Lifecycle Methods with Hooks**:

    **useEffect**: Handles side effects like data fetching, updating the title, or setting up subscriptions after rendering.

11. **Error Boundaries** (if applicable): Catches and handles errors in components to prevent the entire app from crashing.

### Data Handling and Management

1.  **Context API**: Manages global state for data like user authentication and shopping cart, accessible across components.
2.  **Local Storage**: Persists cart items and user preferences, ensuring data remains intact across sessions and page reloads.
